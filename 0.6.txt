the browser sends only one request to the server.
The POST request to the address new_note_spa contains the new note as JSON data containing both the content of the note (content) and the timestamp (date).
The server responds with status code 201 created. This time the server does not ask for a redirect, the browser stays on the same page, and it sends no further HTTP requests.
